# Sea Masters

Your simulator of Battleship game!

## Idea

Frontend part for server project of battleship game. See here --> https://github.com/MonikaKrella/SeaMasters-Battleship. \
The simulation doesn't allow user to make any changes in logic. All of data about game come from server.
User is able only to get starting data, and then manually invoke every turn or run auto mode.
Created only as desktop app. 

## Get started with project

### Before running app
You need node & npm to run this project.
After cloning repository, in root directory invoke "npm i" to install packages.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Ideas for future
 - tests
 - deploy
 - updating UI view
 - player versus computer & player versus player modes
